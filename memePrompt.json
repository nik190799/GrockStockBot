Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff has offered to immediately employ researchers resigning their posts at OpenAI as uncertainty grows about the future of the ChatGPT creator following the axing of boss Sam Altman last week. Salesforce will provide matching compensation to any researcher who has quit OpenAI, Benioff said in a post on X. Benioff's comment came after nearly all of OpenAI's employees threatened to resign and follow ousted leader Altman to work at the company's biggest investor, Microsoft Corp., unless the current board resigns. More than 700 of OpenAI's roughly 770 employees signed a letter on Monday addressed to OpenAI's board stating that the signatories are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgment and care for our mission and employees."

The people who look interesting turn out to be creepier than Frankenstein when you text them. To find a person you'd like to meet is like finding water in the desert. Still, against all odds, once in a while, you'll find someone who is perfect: good pictures, exciting conversation, and proactive. He treats you well, invites you to go on a date, and picks a nice place—a perfect gentleman. Except, when you meet him, he's the opposite: poorly dressed, rude, and can barely keep up a conversation. Bad dates are the normal routine on Tinder. When I was single, I had my fair share of bad dates: guys who don't show up, look different from their profile and have tedious conversations. Overall, those guys act like they don't care about the date, and I always get home feeling like Ugly Betty."
